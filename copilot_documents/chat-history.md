**User:** how do i rename a git branch?

**Assistant:** Let me help you with renaming a Git branch. Let me check the documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information about branch renaming in IntelliJ IDEA.

There are two ways to rename a Git branch in PyCharm:

1. Using the Branches popup or Git tool window:
   - Find the branch you want to rename in the Branches popup or Git tool window
   - Right-click on the branch and select "Rename"
   - Enter the new name in the dialog that opens

2. Using Git commands in the terminal:
   ```bash
   # If you're on the branch you want to rename
   git branch -m new-name
   
   # If you want to rename a different branch
   git branch -m old-name new-name
   ```

After renaming a local branch, if it was previously pushed to a remote repository, you'll need to:
1. Delete the old branch from the remote
2. Push the new branch to the remote
3. Reset the upstream branch

You can do this by using the push action (shortcut: `Ctrl` `Shift` `K`) to push the renamed branch to the remote repository.

Note: Be careful when renaming branches that are shared with other developers, as it may cause confusion. Make sure to communicate the change to your team members.
